## User Experience (UX)

- ### User stories

  - #### As a user i want:
  - Through the design, create an invitation to play and navigate the game instinctively.
  - To persuade and influence the user to have multiple turns.
  - To test and improve memory skills in an entertaining and enjoyable way.
  - Clear scoring when the user completes the game in order to make progress and improve outcome.

- ### Strategy

  The goal is to create a simple, fun game that challenges the person to try again.

- ### Scope

  Feature that should be within the project:

  - Header with name
  - timer for time taken to complete
  - move counter for the amount of moves taken.

- ### Structure

A mockup was created within "Balsamiq Wireframes". Some changes made while creating the game: arrangement of buttons, game cards layout, window with game results.

- #### Color Scheme

  - Colors used
  - ![#ffcc44](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffcc44/000000?text=+) `#ffcc44`
  - ![#53c7fbv](https://via.placeholder.com/15/53c7fb/000000?text=+) `#53c7fb`
  - ![#ffffff](https://via.placeholder.com/15/ffffff/000000?text=+) `#ffffff`

- #### Typography

  - I’ve chosen [Poppins](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins?query=poppin)
    Poppins is one of the Geometric sans serif typefaces that have been a popular design tool for building websites. Each letterform is nearly monolinear, with optical corrections applied to stroke joints were necessary to maintain an even typographic colour.

- #### Imagery

I’ve chosen [CLEANPNG](https://www.cleanpng.com/)
Due to the size requirements of the type of image.

- ### Wireframes

  - To create the wireframes for my game I used balsamiq, just so easy to create mockups quickly and clearly.

  The wireframes include:

  - Desktop Wireframe - [View](assets/wireframe/DesktopWireframe.png)

  - Tablet Wireframe - [View](assets/wireframe/TabletWireframe.png)

  - Mobile Wireframe - [View](assets/wireframe/PhoneWireframe.png)

- ### Features

  - its a memory, but I want the user to be challenged not only by the number of cards but also the time and amount of moves to complete all flips.

  - As it's a game format, I don't want links/navbar, but rather icons with popups using recently learned JavaScript.

  - Responsive on all device sizes

  - Interactive elements
